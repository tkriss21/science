# Interactive Science Simulations

This repository contains a growing collection of interactive science simulations, each built as a single HTML file. These simulations are designed to run directly in modern web browsers, making them ideal for use on iPads, Chromebooks, laptops, and desktops without requiring any installation or additional software.

The goal of this project is to provide fun, engaging, and educational tools for teaching core science concepts. These simulations are inspired by the work of the PhET project at the University of Colorado Boulder, but are created independently and focus on simplicity, portability, and offline usability.

## About

Each simulation is packaged as a standalone HTML file. Simply open the file in any modern browser to start exploring the simulation. These tools are intended for students and educators seeking accessible, interactive ways to explore scientific concepts.

## Features

- Works on iPads, Chromebooks, and all major browsers
- No internet required after download
- Single-file HTML format for easy distribution and use
- Designed for classroom, remote, or independent learning
- Focused on clarity, usability, and hands-on exploration

## Topics Covered

Simulations span several areas of science, including:

- Physics: motion, forces, energy, waves, electricity, and magnetism
- Chemistry: atoms, molecules, reactions, states of matter, and periodic trends
- Earth and Space Science: weather, climate, planetary motion, moon phases, and geology
- Life Science: cells, genetics, ecosystems, evolution, and the human body

More simulations will be added over time.

## How to Use

1. Browse the repository and select a simulation.
2. Download the `.html` file to your device.
3. Open the file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, etc).
4. Interact with the simulation to explore the concept.

These simulations are suitable for use in class, as part of homework assignments, or for independent learning.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you'd like to contribute a new simulation:

1. Fork this repository
2. Add your simulation as a single `.html` file
3. Submit a pull request with a brief description of the topic and functionality

All contributions should prioritize accessibility, interactivity, and educational clarity.
